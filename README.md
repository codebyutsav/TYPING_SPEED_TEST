# ⌨️ Typing Speed Test 🕒

This is a simple **Typing Speed Test** script written in Python. It helps you test your typing speed and accuracy based on randomly selected sentences.

## 🚀 Features

- Random sentence generation 📝  
- Real-time typing speed calculation (WPM) ⚡  
- Character-wise accuracy check ✅  
- Simple and clean terminal interface 🎯  

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No additional libraries required — uses only Python's built-in modules (`time` and `random`).

2. You type the sentence as fast and accurately as possible.
3. It calculates:
   - ⏱️ Time taken
   - 🧠 Typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM)
   - 🎯 Accuracy percentage

## 📂 Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

Just run the script and follow the on-screen instructions.
