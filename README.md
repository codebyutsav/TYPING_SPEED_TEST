This is a simple **Typing Speed Test** script written in Python. It helps you test your typing speed and accuracy based on randomly selected sentences.

## 🚀 Features

- Random sentence generation 📝  
- Real-time typing speed calculation (WPM) ⚡  
- Character-wise accuracy check ✅  
- Simple and clean terminal interface 🎯  

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No additional libraries required — uses only Python's built-in modules (`time` and `random`).
